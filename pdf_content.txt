ABSTRACT
This production thesis explores how Generation Z (Gen Z) in Metro Manila
conceptualizes the "dream home" as a profound symbol of liberation, psychological
sanctuary, and identity. The project addresses a critical gap in existing housing discourse,
which predominantly focuses on pragmatic concerns like economics and physical aesthetics,
by instead delving into the deeply personal and emotional meanings Gen Z attaches to their
ideal dwelling. It asserts that for this generation, a home is not merely a tangible structure
but a subjectively constructed space shaped by lived experiences and aspirational ideals.
The primary output of this project is a multimedia-rich web magazine featuring three
creative nonfiction articles. These articles are the result of in-depth interviews with Gen Z
individuals and are designed to be a human-centered and nuanced exploration of the topic.
The magazine's format is deliberately chosen to align with the digital native sensibilities of
its target audience, utilizing interactive and dynamic elements for engagement. Key
theoretical frameworks, namely Affordance Theory and the Sense of Place framework, guide
the project's creative direction. Affordance Theory is used to design the web magazine in a
way that encourages user participation and emotional connection, while the Sense of Place
framework provides a lens to analyze how interviewees form deep, meaningful connections
to their imagined spaces. By concentrating on the internal, emotional landscape of the
"dream home," this study expands the academic discourse on the subject, recognizing its
crucial role in individual well-being beyond its function as a physical shelter. Ultimately, this
thesis endeavors to reveal the compelling human stories behind a generation’s search for
personal freedom and sanctuary.

I. Introduction
Nature and Description of the Project
For Generation Z (Gen Z) in Metro Manila, the concept of "home" extends far beyond
a physical dwelling, it embodies their aspiration for liberation and psychological sanctuary.
As they navigate the early stages of their careers and the complexities of independent living
in a densely populated urban city, their vision of an ideal living space becomes a powerful
reflection of their deepest desires for autonomy, self-expression, and emotional stability.
With that, the output centers on developing a web magazine designed to explore the
subjective conceptualization of the "dream home" among Gen Z individuals residing in
Metro Manila. A web magazine is particularly helpful for Gen Z because its interactive and
multimedia-rich format aligns with their digital native sensibilities and preference for
dynamic content consumption. Gen Z generally shows a strong preference for digital media
over traditional forms; they are digital natives, having grown up with the internet, social
media, and mobile devices, shaping their expectations for speed, convenience, and
on-demand access (Chang & Chang). The primary objectives of this project are to provide a
profoundly human-centered and psychologically nuanced understanding of the "dream
home" concept for Gen Z, moving beyond superficial aesthetics or mere pragmatic
affordability, and making this accessible and engaging through a digital medium. Specifically,
it aims to explore how lived adversities transform the "dream home" into a potent symbol of
liberation, psychological sanctuary, and identity, thereby expanding the academic discourse

on "home" beyond a physical structure to encompass its vital role in individual well-being
and self-actualization.
Guiding this project are key theoretical frameworks, including Affordance theory
and the Sense of Place framework. Affordance theory, as conceptualized by James Gibson
and refined by Don Norman, offers a lens through which to understand the interactive
potential of our digital web magazine. It focuses on how the platform's design actively
invites Gen Z users to engage with and shape their conceptualizations of a dream home,
creating emotional connection and direct participation rather than passive consumption
(Gibson; Norman). The Sense of Place framework, drawing on the work of Dai and Liu
(2024) and Raymond, Kytta, and Stedman (2020), explores how individuals form profound
meanings about spaces, whether physical or virtual. This framework is instrumental in
examining how Gen Z's "dream home" transcends mere physical structure, becoming an
emotional and aspirational entity shaped by their lived experiences and digital interactions.
The selection of a digital web magazine over a static physical publication is precisely
because its dynamic, interactive, and multimedia capabilities are crucial for capturing the
multifaceted nature of Gen Z's understanding of "home."
Each creative nonfiction article will incorporate customized visual and thematic
elements that directly reflect the interviewees' visions of their ideal homes. This includes
tailored design, color palettes, imagery, and interactive features unique to each narrative,
mirroring the emotional and aesthetic landscape of their "dream home." In addition to these
immersive narratives, the web magazine will feature informational sections, including
'Design & Autonomy,' 'Sustainable Living,' 'Financial Liberation,' and 'Expert Q&A.' It will

--- Page 6 ---

also feature interactive elements like comment sections, a 'Community Forum,' 'Quizzes,'
and 'Reader Submissions.' These components are designed to create an immersive user
experience, allowing readers to virtually "walk through" the narratives and engage with the
multifaceted concept of a dream home. The immersive design will dynamically adjust visual
and interactive elements as users navigate each narrative, symbolically representing the
interviewee's journey in conceptualizing their ideal living space.
This digital medium is particularly fitting as it allows for a dynamic and interactive
presentation of diverse perspectives. It utilizes multimedia elements such as images, videos,
and written narratives to capture the nuanced understanding of "home." The core concept
driving this project is to investigate the intricate relationship between varied lived
experiences and the formation of this ideal "dream home," moving beyond a mere physical
structure to encompass emotional, social, and aspirational dimensions of belonging and
personal space.
Background of the Study
The conceptualization of a "dream home" among Gen Z individuals in Metro Manila
is deeply embedded within a complex social and cultural landscape. This generation, often
characterized as "digital natives," has grown up with unprecedented access to global trends
and architectural aesthetics through social media and online platforms (Manalac). This
exposure has broadened their perspectives on what an ideal home can be, moving beyond
traditional Filipino housing models to embrace diverse design influences such as minimalist,
modern, or eco-friendly concepts (Colliers).

Furthermore, the urban reality of Metro Manila, marked by increasing population
density and rising property costs, significantly shapes their housing aspirations. Metro
Manila's population density, estimated at over 21,000 people per square kilometer, makes it
one of the most densely populated regions in the world (Philippine Statistics Authority).
This intense urbanization is compounded by significant housing cost inflation; for instance,
the national residential real estate price index rose by 5.3% year-on-year in the first quarter
of 2024, presenting a considerable barrier to homeownership for many young professionals
(Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas).
Furthermore, the urban reality of Metro Manila, marked by increasing population
density and rising property costs, significantly shapes their housing aspirations. Metro
Manila is one of the densest regions in the Philippines, leading to challenges in mobility and
a severe lack of urban planning implementation (Alvaira). While traditional Filipino values
often emphasize multi-generational households and close-knit family structures, there is an
observable shift towards nuclear families and single-person households among younger
generations, influencing a demand for housing options that prioritize convenience,
accessibility to work and amenities, and adaptable spaces, such as condominiums and
townhouses (Baricaua).
Economically, navigating early career stages in a highly competitive urban
environment means that affordability and financial stability are significant concerns. A
survey by PhilhealthCare, Inc. (PhilCare) found that while many Gen Z individuals believe
their earnings suffice for retirement and leisure, they lack confidence in managing
unforeseen expenses and view homeownership as an "elusive dream rather than a realistic

--- Page 8 ---
8
possibility" (Manalac). This financial reality often leads them to consider more flexible
options like renting or seeking properties with favorable payment schemes and entry-level
pricing (Baricaua; RichestPH).
Rationale
This production thesis aims to understand the nuanced conceptualization of the
"dream home" among Gen Z, moving beyond superficial aesthetics or mere pragmatic
affordability. Existing architectural media and broader housing discourses, such as high-end
publications like Architectural Digest and specialized issues like YES! Magazine: The
Affordable Housing Issue (2018), frequently showcases aspirational residences and
addresses general housing issues. Yet they often overlook the deeply personal,
psychological, and symbolic meanings individuals, particularly Gen Z, attach to their ideal
dwelling.
Furthermore, this production seeks to address this critical gap by exploring how
challenging lived experiences, such as strict upbringings, persistent financial hardship, or
abusive domestic environments, transform the notion of a "dream home" into a symbol of
liberation, psychological sanctuary, and identity formation. This production critically
differentiates between a 'house' as a tangible physical structure and a 'home' as a dynamic,
emotionally resonant, and subjectively constructed space. The focus is not on architectural
blueprints or property values, but rather on the deeply personal and symbolic meanings
that transform a mere dwelling into a cherished sanctuary and an embodiment of personal
ideals. This, therefore, asserts that for Gen Z, the 'dream home' transcends its architectural

--- Page 9 ---
9
form to become a profoundly subjective, emotional, and psychological 'home', a symbol of
liberation, psychological sanctuary, and identity formation.
This exploration is fundamentally guided by Affordance Theory and the Sense of
Place framework. These frameworks together provide the theoretical lens to analyze how
these subjective, psychological, and symbolic meanings are formed through interaction with
environments, both lived and digital, thereby addressing the gap in current discourses. By
concentrating on the internal experience of the dream home, particularly its emotional
landscape, this study posits that a "dream home" represents a fundamental psychological
aspiration. This perspective expands the academic discourse on "home" beyond its
definition as a physical structure, recognizing its vital role in individual well-being and
self-actualization. Ultimately, this thesis endeavors to reveal the compelling human stories
underlying the 'dream home' for a generation navigating distinctive challenges,
demonstrating that media serves not merely as a source of inspiration but as a critical tool
for psychological coping, aspirational pursuit, and the attainment of personal freedom and
sanctuary.
Assumptions
Only humans can build a home. Jerry Moore, an archaeologist and professor at
California State University, argues in his award-winning book that while animals tend to
construct shelters, humans build homes that hold meaning beyond physical function (1).
Across cultures, people require spaces to gather, work, socialize, and rest. Hasty, Lewis, and
Snipes, researchers from Oregon State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the

--- Page 10 ---
10
University of West Georgia, elucidate that “Dominant ideas about work, gender, marriage,
parenting, hospitality, and status all shape the places we call home. Home involves a
combination of materials, technologies, social relationships, everyday practices, deeply held
values, and shared ideas” (ch. 3). This meaning is expressed in modern architectural designs
and developmental landscape, where the foundation of structures is no longer fixed, but
incessantly recalibrated by human experiences lived through these spaces. (Nicolini 2) The
first assumption of this study is that it is innate for humans to create a home based on their
environment, language, and culture, as each home is made to reflect their respective needs.
However, as social and cultural conditions evolve, what constitutes a home ceases to be
definite. In particular, for younger generations like Gen Z, whose environments are
influenced by digital spaces, economic precarity, and changing family structures, the
meaning of home is becoming more fluid and fragmented.
The second assumption is that while existing discourse on homeownership
highlights its economic and sociological dimensions, the psychological motivations behind
having a dream home remain underexplored. A survey conducted by RocketMortgage, a
retail mortgage lender, reveals that 72% of Gen Z Americans regard homeownership as a
primary aspiration (Lenzen). Another American-based study reports that over 90% of
individuals aged 18 to 44 wish to own a home at some point in their lives (Goodman and
Mayer 32). Whereas, in the Philippines, 39% of Gen Z identify homeownership as one of
their top concerns for the future (Antivola). It is consequential to acknowledge the complex
emotional and psychological factors that drive these homeownership aspirations. In line

--- Page 11 ---
11
with this, Boston Consulting Group, through its Manila division based in Bonifacio Global
City, implemented a study led by Oundjian et al. observing that even those who already own
homes remain hopeful about acquiring better ones that offer greater security (4). It follows
that the factors that define security are more than a material goal, which reveals an ongoing
emotional pursuit.
The notions behind these emotional pursuits are drawn from media portrayals of
houses, aggregated to suggest how a ‘home’ might be defined. Kiessel and Stubbs, professors
from Arkin University of Creative Arts & Design and Cyprus International University,
discovered that science-fiction dystopian houses accentuate societal discourses on class.
They posit that following the depiction of utopian motifs of houses, eventually transformed
by postmodern semiotic transformation, what remains is a sense of human isolation and the
absence of ‘home’ (54-64).
Simultaneously, emotions serve a fundamental purpose in movies, which evoke
positive and negative emotional states in individuals (Luz et. al 4). Building on this, the third
assumption postulates how media, particularly films and television, can affect the housing
aspirations of a dream home. If media can inspire action anchored in storytelling, it
becomes necessary to examine how these portrayals emotionally resonate with audiences,
and in turn, accommodate their vision for a home.

Scope and Limitations
This study will produce a web magazine consisting of three creative nonfiction
articles, complemented by visual designs inspired by architectural and domestic elements.
The magazine will feature narratives from three Filipino Gen Z members, whose
conceptualizations of a dream home are informed by significant personal experiences such
as complex family dynamics, mental health challenges, and formative environments. It will
also address subtopics such as finances, identity formation, education, and environmental
influences, supported by insights from architecture, engineering, and psychology
professionals. These themes will contextualize how the meaning of home for Filipino Gen Z
has evolved in response to shifting social, cultural, and economic factors.
Only three samples will be chosen to allow for a deeper focus on each narrative,
taking into account the diversity of the participants’ backgrounds. Each subject will be
selected based on the richness of their experiences and their potential to yield detailed,
meaningful insights relevant to the topic. They will be treated as individual case studies to
fully capture their lived experiences. In a study published by SAGE Publications, Schoch, a
case study researcher, notes that using a case study “provides you with the chance to get an
in-depth look at the inner workings and interactions of that organization or individual”
(246). To support this approach, purposive sampling will be employed. As van Rijnsoever, a
professor from Utrecht University, explains, “purposive scenarios are much more efficient
than the random chance scenario” (12). This study is limited in scope to a small sample size,
consisting of three Gen Z subjects and three expert informants. As such, the findings will
provide qualitative insights rather than statistically representative conclusions.

Gibson's theory of affordances presents a compelling alternative to how objects are
typically perceived by the mind. Rather than observing an object’s physical features and
mentally interpreting its function, Gibson contends that individuals directly perceive what
the object affords — that is, what actions it makes possible. When applied to digital
environments, such as websites or digital magazines, affordances refer to the immediate,
relational possibilities offered to users: the capacity to learn, to interact, to reflect, or to be
immersed. Within this study’s digital magazine, the narrative affordance of a third-person
perspective will be utilized. According to Gander and Gander, researchers from Sweden,
third-person narratives lead readers to adopt a third-person visual perspective, in which a
vantage point is introduced that allows for a more observational and reflective stance.
Interestingly, they found that readers of nonfiction are more visually aligned with the
protagonist, suggesting a deeper emotional resonance and awareness even when written
from an external viewpoint. This reflects the affordance of the narrative form. It positions
readers as empathetic participants who engage with the material critically.
Furthermore, the project will focus exclusively on the perspectives of Filipino Gen Z
and will not explore the experiences of other generational or national groups. While the
study touches on economic, social, and emotional dimensions of homeownership and
domestic aspirations, it does not claim to address the full range of factors influencing these
phenomena. The project’s production, from the conduct of conducting interviews to the
development of developing the digital magazine, will take place from September to
December 2025. Although only one issue will be developed during the production period,

the project envisions the potential for a continuing series, depending on future interest and
available capacity.
Statement of the Problem
Existing discourse often falls short in exploring the subjective and psychological
dimensions of housing aspirations, particularly how Gen Z individuals in Metro Manila
conceptualize their "dream home" as more than just a dwelling, but as a potent symbol of
liberation and psychological sanctuary. There's a significant gap in understanding how
specific lived adversities influence this unique conceptualization among this demographic.
This study aims to bridge these gaps by investigating how these lived experiences shape
their "dream home" concept and, in turn, how the aesthetic and functional elements they
prioritize in their envisioned homes reflect their pursuit of personal autonomy, identity
expression, and emotional well-being, ultimately offering a more holistic and
psychologically informed perspective on the evolving housing needs and aspirations of Gen
Z.
Study Framework
Theoretical Framework
James Gibson coined the term affordance theory in his book The Ecological Approach
to Visual Perception, first published in 1977. He described affordances as what the
environment offers a person or an animal, meaning the possible actions made available by

--- Page 15 ---
15
objects and surroundings (Gibson 127). According to Gibson, how an object is used is tied to
its physical shape, but affordances also depend on the relationship between the user and the
object. Affordances do not need to be physically noticeable or even consciously perceived.
Osiurak, Rossetti, and Badets explain, “They are objective because they exist independently
of the act of perception, but they are also subjective because the frame of reference is the
individual’s action capabilities.”
Some affordances remain unrecognized until they are acted on. Don Norman
redefined the idea of affordances in the context of Human-Computer Interaction, focusing on
how digital tools offer users possibilities for interaction. He described affordance as “the
perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that
determine just how the thing could possibly be used” (Norman). In this study, the subject
would be Gen Z, and the object would be the digital magazine platform. Affordance refers to
what the platform allows Gen Z to do, such as imagine their dream homes, engage
emotionally, and interact with the content. Norman also emphasized that affordances are
part of communication, which aligns with this study’s aim to make the magazine not just
something to consume, but something that invites participation through feedback,
reflection, and emotional identification.

Conceptual Framework
This study presents a conceptual framework that explores how Gen Z forms their
idea of a dream home. It focuses on two central areas: housing aspirations, which refer to
the psychological, societal, and economic motivations behind wanting a home, and the
mutation of a home, which considers how the meaning of “home” shifts over time and across
contexts. These are examined through the lens of sense of place, a variable adapted from the
framework of Dai and Liu (2024).
While Dai and Liu’s original study is not centered on housing, it explains how both
digital and physical interactions shape people’s experiences of place. They note that “the
fusion of digital and physical space practices enables continuous innovation in our
experiences of place, leading to the formation of a more inclusive and extensive sense of

--- Page 18 ---
18
place” (5). This provides a foundation for understanding how Gen Z may not view home
strictly as a physical structure, but as something shaped by lived experiences, emotions, and
media.
To strengthen this perspective, the study also draws from Raymond, Kytta, and
Stedman (2020), who argue that sense of place research has often overlooked how
meanings are formed through direct perception and sensory engagement. They suggest that
affordance theory can address this by explaining how people form meaning through
real-time interaction with their environment. As they write, “affordance theory could
overcome a number of blind spots in sense of place scholarship” by bridging immediate, felt
experiences with longer-term, socially constructed meanings (11). This supports the study’s
use of affordance theory as its theoretical lens and highlights how Gen Z actively engages
with physical and digital spaces that shape their emotional understanding of home.
Bringing these ideas together, the conceptual framework guides the analysis of how
housing aspirations and changing meanings of home contribute to the conceptualization of a
dream home. These narratives will be expressed through the production of a digital
magazine, which serves as both the creative output and a digital “place” that reflects how
Gen Z imagines, remembers, and aspires toward home. The magazine transforms into a safe
space for both subjects and readers to engage with the evolving idea of what a home can be.

II. Review of Related Literature
The study's review of related literature provides a focused discussion on the "dream
home" concept for Gen Z. All related literature found below are research-based and will
support the content of the articles.
Gen Z’s Conceptualization of the ‘Dream Home’
The "dream home" for Gen Z is not merely a physical structure but a multilayered
and deeply personal concept that embodies aspirations for psychological sanctuary,
liberation, and identity. This conceptualization is contextualized within the unique
socio-economic landscape and digital fluency of this generation. For many, a dream home
serves as a symbol of autonomy, a safe haven from external pressures, and a space for
self-expression.
Paz-Pardo argues that declining homeownership among younger generations is
driven by a lack of financial security and rising house prices, forcing many to delay this life
milestone (2022). Sheedy, Shah, and Pan's research on young adults in Australia
corroborates this, finding that while homeownership remains a key aspiration for many, a
significant minority rejects it for the sake of freedom and flexibility (2023). This desire for
freedom is also a key driver for those who opt to delay ownership to pursue other lifestyle
goals. Abidoye et al.'s study in Jakarta, Indonesia, further reinforces these findings, noting
that while homeownership is a major challenge, young adults are driven by functional
motivations like a place to live or to start a family, rather than by pride or social status

--- Page 20 ---
20
(2020). The authors identify affordability and insufficient income as crucial barriers.
Similarly, Byun and Shon’s research on South Korean youth highlights that while co-living is
a pragmatic solution to reduce costs, young adults often frame it as a lifestyle choice to
conceal the reality of their limited options (2022). This "duplicity" suggests that for many,
housing decisions are a compromise between economic reality and a desire to maintain a
certain image.
The collective findings from these studies demonstrate a significant disconnect
between the traditional aspiration of homeownership and the realities faced by Gen Z. The
broader context of this literature suggests that while the "dream home" remains a powerful
ideal, its conceptualization is undergoing a fundamental shift. Financial precarity and a
desire for freedom have led to a re-evaluation of what constitutes a stable and fulfilling
living situation. Homeownership is no longer the sole marker of success, with many Gen Z
individuals prioritizing flexibility and experiential living. This interpretation highlights a
new dynamic where housing choices are not just about securing an asset, but about
navigating a complex landscape of financial constraints, personal values, and psychological
needs.
This literature is highly relevant as it provides a foundation for exploring Gen Z's
unique conceptualization of the "dream home." The research informs this study by
validating that housing decisions are driven by economic necessity, personal aspirations for
freedom, and psychological well-being. The findings from Paz-Pardo and Abidoye et al.
provide essential context on the financial barriers facing this generation, while Sheedy, Shah,
and Pan's work highlights the emerging trade-off between security and freedom. The

--- Page 21 ---
21
concept of "duplicity" from Byun and Shon is particularly insightful, as it allows us to
analyze how Gen Z’s public portrayal of their housing choices may differ from their private
motivations. This allows the study to move beyond a simplistic view of housing and
investigate how economic and societal pressures are actively reshaping what a "dream
home" truly means for this generation.
Housing Aspirations
Housing aspirations refer to an individual's personal goals and desires regarding
their ideal living situation. These aspirations are not static, they are a behavioral response to
an individual's current residential environment, shaped by a combination of personal
feelings, mental assessments of their living situation, and the influence of cultural and social
norms.
The reviewed literature offers a comprehensive understanding of housing
aspirations as a complex concept. Opoko et al. (2015) explore aspirations within an informal
urban settlement, revealing that residents' desires to move are driven by a combination of
practical factors such as poor living conditions, household size, and a need for exclusive
facilities, as well as personal circumstances like age and marital status. Their research posits
that housing aspiration is a behavioral response rooted in an individual's subjective
assessment of their environment and is a key predictor of mobility or home modification
(Opoko et al. 119). Similarly, Diaz-Serrano's study on homeownership and housing
satisfaction demonstrates a strong link between tenure status and perceived well-being
(2009). The research found that a change from renting to owning significantly increases

--- Page 22 ---
22
housing satisfaction, suggesting that a portion of this satisfaction is a result of fulfilling the
expectation or aspiration to own a home. This underscores the psychological and emotional
weight attached to achieving one's housing goals.
These studies collectively highlight that housing aspirations are a crucial component
of an individual's overall well-being and are influenced by a complex relationship of
personal circumstances and external factors. The broader context of this literature suggests
that while aspirations are deeply personal, they are not formed in a vacuum, they are a
direct response to an individual's current living conditions, as seen in the desire for better
facilities in informal settlements. The findings also indicate a significant emotional and
psychological reward tied to fulfilling these aspirations, particularly when it comes to the
cultural ideal of homeownership. This interpretation emphasizes that housing is a central,
and often emotional, aspect of human life, and a primary driver for major life decisions.
This literature is highly relevant to the study because it provides a foundational
understanding of what drives housing aspirations beyond simple aesthetics. The findings
from Diaz-Serrano are insightful, as they suggest that the emotional satisfaction of achieving
a "dream home" may be tied less to the physical structure itself and more to the fulfillment
of the aspiration to own. This provides a valuable lens for the study, allowing researchers to
investigate whether Gen Z's "dream home" is an authentic desire for a specific type of space
or a response to societal expectations and the psychological gratification of achieving a
significant life milestone.

--- Page 23 ---

Psychological Factors
Psychological factors, in the context of this study, are defined as the mental and
emotional aspects that shape a person's relationship with their living space. These include
emotions, well-being, sense of security, and the psychological benefits derived from a home.
The reviewed literature highlights the profound psychological significance of home
environments. Graham, Gosling, and Travis argue that despite the considerable emotional
and financial investment people place in their homes, psychological research has largely
overlooked this domain (346). They advocate for a deeper study into how homes serve as a
real-world context for social, developmental, and cognitive processes, suggesting that homes
are vital for emotional regulation and well-being. This perspective is supported by Park and
Kim, who investigated the relationship between homeownership and life satisfaction
(2023). Their research found that while homeownership can boost life satisfaction, this
psychological benefit is significantly diminished for individuals who experience housing
affordability stress, indicating that the emotional reward is tied to financial security. Further
reinforcing this, Seo and Park examined the link between housing and the mental health of
young adults living independently (2021). Their study reveals a negative association
between perceived poor housing quality and material hardship and the mental health of
young adults, especially those living alone, highlighting the critical role of a stable and
quality living environment in promoting psychological well-being during the transition to
adulthood.

--- Page 24 ---
24
The collective findings from these studies underscore that the home is not merely a
backdrop for life but an active and influential agent in a person's psychological well-being.
The literature demonstrates that the emotional and mental benefits of a home, including a
sense of sanctuary, stability, and satisfaction, are tangible and measurable. The aspiration
for a "dream home" is therefore a deep psychological pursuit, yet the research also suggests
this pursuit is fraught with challenges. The psychological rewards of home are conditional
on factors like affordability and housing quality. This implies that for a generation facing
economic precarity, their "dream home" is more than a desire, it is a fundamental
psychological need for security and a stable environment, which may be at odds with their
current reality.
This literature is highly relevant as it provides a basis for exploring the psychological
dimensions of the "dream home" for Generation Z. The research informs this study by
validating that the home is a critical context for psychological processes, including
emotional regulation and identity formation. The findings from Park and Kim and Seo and
Park are particularly insightful, as they directly link housing affordability and quality to
mental health outcomes in young adults. This allows the study to move beyond superficial
aesthetics and investigate how lived adversities, such as a lack of a stable home
environment, can intensify the desire for a "dream home" as a symbol of mental well-being
and a space of personal sanctuary.

--- Page 25 ---
25
Societal Factors
Societal factors, in the context of this study, are defined as the social norms, cultural
values, and shared beliefs that influence a generation's perceptions and aspirations
regarding housing. These elements extend beyond individual financial capacity and include
the emotional and psychological weight placed on the concept of "home," such as its role in
establishing identity, social standing, and a sense of belonging.
The reviewed literature provides a multifaceted understanding of the societal and
cultural influences on housing aspirations. Preece highlights the significant role of
socio-cultural factors, such as identity and social norms, in guiding people's views on
housing (2018). This research suggests a need to investigate whether new trends, such as
house-sharing, are a lifestyle choice or a coping strategy for young adults. In a related vein,
Odermatt and Stutzer challenge the widespread belief that homeownership intrinsically
leads to happiness. Their study found that home buyers, particularly those with
extrinsically-oriented life goals, often systematically overestimate the life satisfaction they
will gain from owning a home, suggesting that a socially ingrained belief may drive the
aspiration more than the reality (2022). Complementing this, Zavisca and Gerber discuss
how homeownership functions as a socio-cultural foundation for stability and belonging.
They explain that beyond its material value as an asset, a home can embody an extension of
the self, signal social status, and enhance a sense of community, thereby influencing
subjective well-being and civic engagement (2016).

--- Page 26 ---
26
These studies collectively demonstrate that the "dream home" is not merely a
financial or logistical goal but a deeply embedded social and psychological ideal. The
literature suggests that society's traditional view of homeownership as the ultimate symbol
of happiness, stability, and success may be a cultural construct that is being re-evaluated.
For a generation navigating unprecedented social and economic shifts, the emotional and
social motivations behind housing choices are more complex than ever. The research
indicates a potential gap between a deeply held cultural ideal and the realized experiences
of homeownership, pointing to the possibility that young adults may be seeking different,
perhaps less traditional, avenues to achieve the sense of stability and identity historically
associated with owning a home.
This literature is highly relevant as it provides a strong academic basis for exploring
the social and cultural dimensions of the "dream home" for Gen Z. The research informs this
study by highlighting that a home is more than a physical shelter, it is a social and
psychological concept tied to identity and social norms. These findings are crucial for
investigating whether Gen Z still holds the traditional ideal of homeownership or if they are
actively redefining what "home" means to them, prioritizing new social norms like
community-based living or flexibility. The research also helps to frame the analysis of
whether Gen Z's aspirations are driven by a genuine desire for the benefits of
homeownership or by a socially conditioned belief that it leads to happiness.

Economic Factors
Economic factors, in the context of this study, refer to the financial and market
conditions that influence an individual's ability to acquire, afford, and maintain a home.
These factors include but are not limited to income levels, employment stability, housing
affordability, interest rates, and the broader macroeconomic environment. For Gen Z, these
elements are particularly significant as they shape the gap between their housing
aspirations and the practical realities they face.
Preece et al. examine the literature on housing aspirations, arguing for a more
precise definition of the term and a move away from focusing solely on homeownership
(90). The authors highlight how broader trends, such as declining homeownership rates,
affordability issues, and precarious labor markets, are fundamentally reshaping people's
housing goals. Building on this, Galiani et al. present a study on aspiration adaptation in
resource-constrained environments (2021). Their research indicates that while individuals
in poor neighborhoods may initially increase their housing aspirations in response to
community upgrades, these aspirations eventually decay and return to baseline levels when
faced with persistent resource limitations. This suggests that without the means to act on
them, aspirations can fade. Finally, Vaidynathan et al. analyze the effect of economic
indicators on housing prices, concluding that factors like CPI, real GDP, and interest rates
significantly influence the real estate market (201). The authors emphasize the need for
policies that increase housing supply to mitigate price hikes and address the demand for
affordable housing.

--- Page 28 ---
28
These studies collectively demonstrate a critical disjunction between an individual's
housing aspirations and the economic realities that enable or hinder their achievement. The
literature confirms that aspirations are not static but are shaped by a complex relationship
of personal desires, social context, and financial capacity. In the broader context, this means
that for a generation facing significant economic precarity, the "dream home" is less of a
fixed ideal and more of a fluid concept that must constantly be adapted to external
pressures. The research underscores that simply desiring a home is insufficient, the ability
to realize that desire is deeply tied to market conditions and resource availability, which, as
shown, can be both a source of hope and a source of frustration.
This studies are relevant as it provides a strong academic basis for understanding
how economic factors define and limit the conceptualization of the "dream home" for Gen Z.
The research informs this study by highlighting that aspirations for housing are not fixed
ideals but are fluid and must be constantly adapted to financial realities. It provides a lens to
analyze how Gen Z's ideals may be shaped by the threat of aspiration fatigue, or the
possibility of scaling down their dreams in the face of affordability issues and unstable labor
markets. These insights are crucial for investigating how broader market forces and
financial limitations directly influence Gen Z's housing expectations and choices, ultimately
positioning the study to uncover the dynamic and often constrained nature of their housing
dreams.

Mutation of Home
People would not be holistically satisfied with their needs if not for their homes.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, coined by Abraham Maslow in 1943, established a framework
wherein human needs are identified at a hierarchical level. Maslow’s theory contends that
basic survival needs must be met before an individual can pursue higher-level psychological
needs (Maslow). The physiological needs located at the bottom of his pyramid framework
include necessary conditions for human survival, such as air, food, drink, shelter, clothing,
warmth, sex, and sleep. These needs are seen as paramount and must be fulfilled in order to
attain the other levels of human needs.
Shelter, then, as elucidated by Samanani et al., researchers from The Cambridge
Encyclopedia of Anthropology, has always been central to how people experience and define
their humanity: “houses, homes, and practices of homemaking have been an inescapable
background within anthropological writing throughout the discipline’s history.” The
implications of a house and a home serve as a foundation to further understand key social
science theories, from how family relationships are defined, how social status is maintained
across generations, to how our senses are influenced by our environment. They furthermore
theorize that “when we imagine home, it is often not the structures themselves but the
feelings, practices, and relationships within familiar spaces which give home a powerful
sense of belonging.” The meaning of home is one that transforms and transcends, a story
that is constant in changing the definition according to its readers.

--- Page 30 ---
30
The mutation of how home is defined does not confine a definite circumstance, race,
or religion. Home mutates because of how much it is desired and how relevant it still is in
attaining the necessary conditions to be considered human. In Christianity, the Book of
Genesis tells of the Garden of Eden, where the first humans, Adam and Eve, were placed in
their original “home.” The biblical paradise was intended to have everything to satisfy the
humans so that they would never want for more (The Bible, Gen. 2.15). This signifies how a
home has always been intended to provide one’s needs. When Eve became enlightened by
the serpent, it can be argued that her definition of a home, a paradise, no longer simply
encapsulated her current shelter, because she wanted more. From this, it is clear that this
phenomenon is inevitable: as society continues to change and humanity evolves, the only
constant is the mutation in how a home is perceived.
Home as a House
The house is an intimate extension of a person’s identity, built upon layers of
memory, development, and lived experience. While the term “house” is broadly defined as “a
building for habitation,” the word “home” is first and foremost “the place where a person or
animal dwells” and only secondarily “the place where one lives or was brought up, with
reference to the feelings of belonging, comfort, etc., associated with it” (Oxford English
Dictionary). These two definitions are often used synonymously. In informal spaces like
social media, for instance, phrases such as “moving house” and “moving home” are used

--- Page 31 ---
31
without much thought for their deeper meanings. Still, to define a house is to trace the
trajectory of one’s personal and cultural history.
In the Philippine context, architecture carries its own social narrative. According to
Del Castillo and Corpuz-Mendoza, researchers from the College of Architecture at the
University of the Philippines Diliman, the meaning of a house varies depending on
socioeconomic background. Informal settlers associate it primarily with shelter and family.
Project housing residents value the role of community. Residents of gated subdivisions
express more individualized meanings tied to self-expression and status (Del Castillo and
Corpuz-Mendoza). Their study also notes that many homes in the country are not designed
by professional architects or well-known designers. Instead, they are often self-built or
modified with the help of skilled laborers. This raises a critical discussion investigating what
people genuinely value in the spaces they build or buy for themselves?
Historical conditions further shape how houses have been conceptualized.
Yamaguchi, a researcher from Ateneo de Manila University, writes about how Filipino elites
during the American colonial period constructed “American-style” wooden houses in the
absence of American-built homes for Filipinos. These structures, which followed the visual
language of colonial superiority, reflected aspirations for modernity and became part of
family legacies and rising social status. Yamaguchi argues that these homes were not just
places of dwelling but physical assertions of colonial alignment (Yamaguchi). This also
opens a critical lens. During colonization, the home for many Filipinos may have been
reduced to merely a house, shaped by inherited systems and hierarchies that left little room

--- Page 32 ---
32
for personal or cultural growth. In such a setting, even calling a place “home” might have felt
like a luxury because identifying as Filipino was itself a complicated act.
Home as a Form of Security
The constructs of a home are immortalized in what it offers to its inhabitants. The
word security holds multiple meanings. It is defined as “the quality or state of being secure,”
such as “freedom from danger” and “freedom from fear or anxiety” (Merriam-Webster
Dictionary). In the book Living with Buildings, Ian Sinclair, a writer and filmmaker from
London, highlights how buildings and structures “can isolate and endanger us, but they can
also heal us. We project our hopes and fears onto buildings, while they absorb our histories.”
The process of formulating the meaning of a home may seem uncomplicated on the
surface, but the cognitive and emotional layers behind it are intricate. According to Sigmon,
Whitcomb, and Snyder, researchers in the field of community psychology, “the psychological
home addresses a feeling of connection and belonging to others that goes beyond a physical
dwelling.” Similarly, Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher, elaborated on the idea of
dwelling as the connection formed between people and places, making it a philosophical
inquiry into existence.
The way people perceive home as a form of security varies and can be seen as a need
that is constantly desired and influenced by different realities. In Malaysia, for instance,
Ismael et al., researchers from the Universiti Sains Malaysia, found that the concept of secure

--- Page 33 ---
33
homes often points to gated or protected residential areas. However, there is no single
authoritative definition of what makes a home secure, since people define it based on their
circumstances. To someone wealthy, it might mean privacy and protection in an exclusive
neighborhood. To someone less privileged, it could simply mean having a roof over their
head and a space that keeps their family together.
In a study conducted by Capistrano et al., scholars from Colegio de San Juan de
Letran in Calamba, Laguna uncovered that the idea of home among adolescents was rooted
in love, unity, peace, and understanding. These participants had experienced trauma,
including physical and sexual abuse from family members, yet they found a sense of home in
a shelter that provided them emotional and physical safety. Even in more unconventional
spaces, the idea of home continues to evolve. Duncan, a fandom enthusiast from the
University of the Witwatersrand, points out that home is an often an overlooked concept in
fandom communities, where shared digital spaces can offer comfort and a sense of
belonging.
Altogether, the idea of home as a form of security is not limited to its physical
structure. It also includes the emotional, relational, and cultural elements that is integrated
in how individuals feel safe, connected, and whole.

Digital Magazine
A digital magazine possesses information that continues to engage its reader,
bringing to life stories that have yet to be heard. But what makes it different from other
forms of medium, when it can be used all the same to tell a story? In an age where people
are using artificial intelligence for their therapy, it is not too far-fetched to rely on digital
media to enrich people’s minds. The shift from traditional to digital publishing has redefined
how audiences engage with media.
In the Philippines, Summit Media’s complete digital transformation in 2018 serves as
a key example. Once known for its popular print titles such as Cosmopolitan and Candy, the
company shut down its remaining six print magazines and successfully migrated all its
content online. Summit Media president Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng explained that this pivot
was driven by their respect for audience behavior and the evolution of digital consumption.
Brands like Cosmo.ph and Preview.ph have since thrived in the digital space, continuing to
uphold their distinct voices while catering to Gen Z’s online habits (“Summit Media
Completes”).
This trend is echoed globally by companies like NME (New Musical Express), which,
after 66 years in print, ceased publication and transitioned into an online-only platform in
2018. Despite the print edition’s wide distribution, it failed to meet financial expectations.
As NME editor Charlotte Gunn noted, “From the moment we closed the print mag, we were a
profitable business again” (Clarke). By November of the same year, NME reportedly reached

--- Page 35 ---
35
the highest number of unique monthly users in its 22-year digital history (Clarke). Clarke, a
journalist for The Drum, emphasized that this success illustrates the potential for
profitability and reach in digital formats.
These examples affirm the viability and potential of digital magazines as interactive,
accessible, and sustainable mediums. Julie Dayton, an engineer from Western Michigan
University, emphasizes how digital media is quicker, more affordable, and capable of
reaching wider audiences than traditional formats (Dayton). Similarly, Henderson, Finger,
and Selwyn, educators from Australian universities, argue that mobile accessibility increases
engagement, particularly among students, allowing publications to be viewed anywhere
through a simple web link (Henderson et al.).
Beyond practicality, the digital magazine serves as a site of affordance. According to
sociologist Ian Hutchby, affordances are “functional and relational aspects, which frame,
while not determining, the possibilities for agentic action in relation to an object” (444). In
digital contexts, this means that technology enables but does not dictate user behavior,
making room for interactivity, personalization, and engagement. Leonardi and Barley,
scholars in organizational communication and sociology, further argue that technology’s
materiality and human agency intersect to shape its use, making the concept of affordance
especially useful in studying digital spaces (Leonardi and Barley 161).
This supports the structure of The Haven, a digital magazine where readers get to
conceptualize their own dream home along the way. They are not passive consumers but

--- Page 36 ---
36
active participants, scrolling through dream houses, listening to soundbites, and leaving
real-time comments.
Compared to a static PDF or print format, a digital magazine offers an immersive,
story-driven experience. The Haven envisions a publication that mimics entering a home,
using visual transitions, animated elements, and sound. This not only draws readers in but
also addresses Gen Z’s shortened attention spans and preference for dynamic, mobile-first
content. In line with Christine Greenhow and Benjamin Chapman, teachers from Michigan
State University who found that digital tools support civic participation and active learning,
The Haven aims to be a hybrid platform for storytelling, emotional resonance, and
community-building (Greenhow and Chapman 6–8).
Thus, the digital magazine as a medium aligns with the study’s aim to understand
how Gen Z imagines their dream homes. The digital format does more than spread
awareness. It invites readers to inhabit it, as a home would do.
Gap in Literature
Research on housing has largely focused on practical and structural concerns,
particularly those tied to economic stability, ownership, and shelter as mentioned in the
previous sections. These studies often address housing access, urban development, and
policy-related frameworks. While crucial, such scholarship leaves a gap in understanding

--- Page 37 ---
37
the emotional, psychological, and symbolic dimensions of home, especially how individuals,
especially younger generations like Gen Z, conceptualize their “dream home.”
Samanani et al. maintain that although homes shape the very foundation of social
life, they are frequently treated as self-evident and remain underexamined in analytical
discourse. The house is often viewed as a static backdrop rather than an active component
of identity, memory, and aspiration. Following this line of reasoning, Del Castillo observes
that much of the literature on Filipino architecture lacks deeper engagement with how
Filipino culture both communicates and is communicated through built structures. Cultural
values, aspirations, and meanings embedded in these spaces are often overlooked in favor of
more utilitarian analyses.
Marta et al., a team of Italian educators, strengthen this oversight in global housing
literature. While acknowledging the role of home in personal well-being, they note that few
studies have examined the lived experiences of individuals transitioning from homelessness
to independent housing, again emphasizing the lack of focus on daily life and emotional
attachment.
These gaps highlight the need for more nuanced, interdisciplinary inquiries into how
people imagine, idealize, and emotionally relate to their homes. This study attempts to
respond to that absence by examining the reasons why Gen Z leans into the idea of a “dream
home.”

III. Methodology
A. Method
Format of the creative nonfiction articles
Various articles and columns collectively served as a basis for the webzine. In terms
of the writing style, the researchers took inspiration from The New Yorker. The publication
is regarded for its long-form articles, many of which range from 2,000 to 10,000 words in
length. An example of one that follows the researchers’ preferred storytelling approach is A
House Is Not a Home by Eula Biss, which uses personal anecdotes and philosophical musings
to explore the profound meanings embedded in domestic spaces, mirroring the project's
storytelling approach. Each article will be a long-form piece, ranging from 1,500 to 3,000
words, designed to provide in-depth, human-centered narratives that capture the subjective
experiences of Generation Z individuals. The choice of this format is deliberate, as it allows
for the nuanced exploration of how lived adversities and aspirations for autonomy are
manifested in a person's vision of their ideal home.
Format and creative direction of the webzine
The project will consist of three creative nonfiction articles, each supported by
customized visual and thematic elements. The web magazine's design will be highly
intentional, with a unique color palette, imagery, and interactive features for each narrative,

--- Page 39 ---
39
directly reflecting the interviewees' visions of their ideal homes. The immersive design will
dynamically adjust visual and interactive elements, as users navigate each narrative,
symbolically representing the interviewee's journey in conceptualizing their ideal living
space. To further enhance this immersive experience, soundbites from the interviews will be
included, allowing users to hear the authentic voices and emotions of the individuals as they
describe their dream homes. This approach is guided by Affordance Theory, which ensures
the platform's design actively invites user participation and emotional engagement, and the
Sense of Place framework, which is used to capture how each interviewee's "dream home"
transcends a mere physical structure to become an emotional and aspirational entity. The
webzine is conceived as an interactive journey, where the user does not simply read about a
dream home but experiences its formation alongside the narrative's protagonist.
Data Collection
Sampling Procedure
The chosen sampling procedure for this qualitative study is purposive sampling.
This method, also known as judgmental or selective sampling, involves intentionally
selecting participants based on their specific characteristics and relevance to the research
question. The researchers' judgment is key in identifying individuals who can provide rich,
in-depth insights into the phenomenon under investigation, in this case, the subjective
conceptualization of a "dream home" among Generation Z in Metro Manila. The goal is not to

--- Page 40 ---
40
generalize findings to a larger population, but to deeply understand the diverse and
nuanced experiences of a targeted group. This procedure allows for the efficient collection
of highly relevant data from individuals whose backgrounds and lived adversities directly
inform the research's core themes.
Purposive sampling offers several strengths, including the ability to select
"information-rich" cases, which is crucial for the depth required in qualitative research. It is
also a cost-effective and time-efficient method, as it focuses resources on gathering
high-quality data from a select few rather than a large, random sample. However, this
method also has significant weaknesses, most notably limited generalizability and the
potential for researcher bias. Because the sample is not random, the findings may not
represent the full diversity of Generation Z in Metro Manila, and the researchers' subjective
criteria for selection could introduce bias. To mitigate these weaknesses, the study will aim
for theoretical generalization. While acknowledging that its findings may not be statistically
generalizable, this approach ensures that the insights gained will contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of the "dream home" concept. This rich, contextual
knowledge can then be applied by other researchers and practitioners to similar contexts.

Contacting the Participants
The stories on the CNF articles will be sourced from three mutual friends of the
researchers. The pair reached out to them via private messaging and properly briefed them
on the nature of the thesis. Upon signing the informed consent form, the researchers will ask
each of them to enumerate what particular subject matter(s) they will be comfortable
discussing. An in-depth interview via Zoom will be conducted afterwards in relation to these
subject matter(s).
Each interview will run for approximately 45-60 minutes. Afterwards, an audio
recording will be generated solely for transcription purposes. This will be a crucial step in
the production process to ensure that the participants will not be misquoted.
